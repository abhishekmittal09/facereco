Face Recognition Tool


The facial recognition problem can be approached as a 2-D recognition problem. The approach involves using Principal Component Analysis, in which the face images are projected onto a feature space that covers the significant variations among known face images. The significant features (eigenfaces) are the principal components of the sets of faces. Since projection operation characterized an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals for identification.


The project here contains matlab codes which were tested on 3 different datasets.

The Report present in the directory gives detailed explanation of the procedure followed along with the comparasion of results.

The paper refered for the project is also present in the directory.
